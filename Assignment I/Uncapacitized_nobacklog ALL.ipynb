    "The first observation is that the Setups are minimized by clustering them together(at-least for the selected instances), as the model aims to reduce the frequency of costly setups(setup costs are really high), leading to grouped production that satisfies future demand while keeping inventory costs low. This patterns—setup minimization is fundamental to achieving optimal solutions in this problem, ensuring that the model always finds an efficient balance between setup costs, production costs, and inventory holding costs."
